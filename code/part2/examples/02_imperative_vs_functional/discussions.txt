Do not confuse familiar with simple and unfamiliar with complex

Something that is familiar may be simple or complex
Something that is unfamiliar may be simple or complex

Both imperative style and functional style code may be simple or complex

However, in general terms, imperative style has more accidental complexity
compared to well written functional style code
