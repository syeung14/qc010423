Do you think long methods are a good idea? No

Do you see long methods at work? Yes

How long is long?

1000 lines is long? yes
100? humm
10? hummmmmm

The long method is not about the size of the method.
Then how to determine?

A method should focus on a single level of abstraction or  details
SLAP more than SRP

Think about how we communicate with each other

We start with a high level detail. We don't get into the low level 
details until we are ready to dive into those details.

We communicate in one level of abstraction between humans.

This helps us to comprehend and deal with complexity

Abstractions help us to cope with complexity

Compose method pattern - a function is composed of 
instructions at the right level of detail or abstraction

whereas SRP is interesting, I value SLAP more than SRP for this reason

Look at functions from two points of view:
1. Look at it from the user of abstraction point of view
2. Look at it from the maintainer point of view

Then address 2 without compromising 1. Do not make it harder for the
users first, then make it easier for the maintainers.

Chopping functions may not be helpful for the users though it may help
the maintainers. Strike a balance and focus on SLAP to get that balance.
